Ques) There is an organisation where there are 3 types of departments. Each department is having 15-20 employees. The employees work for a fixed number of hours and they have a unique ID so that they can be recognised. The information related to employees is stored in a different table emp_basic_details, which may include number of dependents and other family details. Design ER Diagram.
